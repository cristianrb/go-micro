If you’re using a M1 machine to develop and you want to deploy your application to Linode/DigitalOcean/etc, take care to build and define the GOOS and GOARCH.

> go env GOOS GOARCH
darwin
arm64
Just building defining the GOOS, your target will be “default” to arch=arm64
Linode and other VPS’s normally run at x86_64, so it don’t will work.

node-1:/swarm$ uname -a
Linux node-1 5.4.0-122-generic #138-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jun 22 15:00:31 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Before build your image, take care to have something like:

env GOOS=linux CGO_ENABLED=0 GOARCH=amd64 go build -o BinaryName .

Thanks for that. It's helpful. I just picked up my first Apple silicon machine a week ago.

An additional note for using Mac M1 machine to deploy to remote server:


Apart from setting the golang build architecture to GOARCH=amd64, we also need to set the docker build architecture to linux/amd64. So instead of running:
docker build -f broker-service.dockerfile -t tcs/broker-service:1.0.0 .

We need to run:
docker build -f broker-service.dockerfile --platform linux/amd64 -t tcs/broker-service:1.0.0 .

Hope this help those who are running on M1 machines.
